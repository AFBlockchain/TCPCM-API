  summary: Create Report
  operationId: createReport
  description: |
    Register a quiz under the given course by supplying `courseID`, `title` and `description`. Return the created report.

    This operation SHOULD only be carried out after the professor has properly linked students and experts to a course(class), so that in the backend the participation information can be properly propagated to the created report.

    This call also automatically creates all "record"s for every student in this course.

    Exceptions:
      * No authority
      * Course not found
      * Invalid arguments
